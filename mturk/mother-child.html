	<!-- Include my library, [mmturkey][mmturkey], which manages submitting data to Mechanical Turk. This defines a global object, <code>turk</code>, and attaches five properties to it, <code>hitId</code>, <code>assignmentId</code>, <code>workerId</code>, <code>previewMode</code>, and <code>turkSubmitTo</code>. It also provides a single method, <code>submit(data)</code>, which you use to submit data to Turk. If no submission URL has been provided (because, e.g. you're testing your code outside of the Turk environment), <code>submit</code> displays what would have been submitted (without, obviously, any Turk-specific variables like <code>workerId</code> and <code>assignmentId</code>).  -->

	<p class="block-text">In this experiment, you will see short exchanges between a mother and her child. The words of the exchange will be displayed one at a time and each new utterance will be labeled with the speaker.<br><br>Press <span id="advance-key" class="key">{{}}</span> to see the next word in the exchange.<br><br>
	Following each exchange, you will answer a question about the exchange you saw. You will see two statements on the screen: one that the mother said in the previous exchange and one that the mother did not say in the previous exchange. Select the statement that you saw by pressing <span id="true-key", class="key">{{}}</span> if the statement you saw is at the top of the screen or <span id="false-key" class="key">{{}}</span> if the statement you saw is at the bottom of the screen. These instructions will be repeated for each question.

<!-- Include the <a href="experiment.html">JavaScript file for the experiment</a>. As written, that script immediately executes commands, so we include it here at the end of the HTML file to ensure that resources referenced by the script actually exist. For instance, one of the immediately executed commands is <code>showSlide("instructions")</code>. If we loaded experiment.js, say, in the <code>head</code> section, <code>showSlide("instructions")</code> would fail because the <code>instructions</code> slide doesn't exist yet. It is possible to load the script in <code>head</code> but you have to ensure that any immediately executed commands, if they rely on potentially uninitialized HTML elements, are _delayed_ until the page is ready, using either [window.onload][onload] or jQuery's more robust [$(document).ready()][domReady]  -->
